        Despite the significant progress India has made, a large number of people still face the risk of food insecurity. Hunger continues to affect vulnerable communities, and the need for basic resources like food, clothing, and educational tools remains critical.
          <br></br>
          <br></br> Inspired by initiatives like Feeding India by Zomato, which provides daily meal support to those in need, our project is focused on delivering consistent assistance to families struggling with essential resources.
